#Question: Write an algorithm to find the ‘next’ node (e.g., in-order successor) of a given node in a binary search tree where each node has a link to its parent.
#if node has left sub node, then that is successpr
#if node is a left node then -> parent
#if noce is right node then call next node on parent
